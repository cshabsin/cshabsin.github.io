There's another topic that I am considering writing about here from time to
time.

## Puzzles

### Crosswords

I do crossword puzzles from a bunch of online sources

* [American Values Crosswords](https://avxwords.com/)
* Cryptic crosswords from various sources.
* Variety puzzles (cryptic and otherwise)
* [Boswords](https://boswords.org)
* [Crosshare](https://crosshare.org/) and [7xwords](https://www.7xwords.com/)
* [Washington Post Sundays](https://www.washingtonpost.com/crossword-puzzles/sunday-evan-birnholz/)
* [Crucinova](https://crucinova.com/)

I might occasionally point out interesting puzzles, especially if I can find 
a way to put discussion of the solution behind some kind of spoiler blocker.

### Puzzle Hunts

I've also participated in a number of puzzle hunts. 

* [The MIT Mystery Hunt](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/)
* [Panda Magazine](https://pandamagazine.com)
* The [Galactic Puzzle Hunt](https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/) (though I am a bit behind on these)
  
I only recently realized that I need a different strategy for getting better
at these. I'm able to solve some puzzles, and completely unable to solve 
other ones. For quite some time, my strategy involved trying a puzzle,
succeeding or failing, and then moving on. 

The new step I'm introducing? Make sure to give up eventually, and read the 
solution! I hope this will lead to some real learning, rather than stubborn
prideful stagnancy.

I might occasionally write up interesting solves.
