I've been messing around in my spare time with Go and Javascript and Typescript and trying to get a taste of what development outside Google is like, in completely non-consequential forms.

Projects I've worked on and need to document: 
* Advent of Code solutions. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly set of programming puzzles released, one per day, on December 1-25. Some people do them competitively, I just do them for fun. This year I'm hoping to use a local install of Go 1.18 from head to try to apply Go with Generics to the problems.
* a simple Javascript starmap for a role-playing game I'm in (hopefully migrating to Typescript if I can figure out how to best get that served... maybe from github.io instead of my personal site?)
* an Appengine-hosted website for managing the RSVPs for a yearly event my wife and I run. This was ported to Go/Appengine from a friend's old Python server (on django, I think?) and hacked together in the wee hours of the night to serve our purposes in a quick and dirty fashion. I have hopes of cleaning up that codebase and making it suitable for sharing.
* and apparently now I'm learning enough Ruby to make this Jekyll-based github.io service do my bidding.
