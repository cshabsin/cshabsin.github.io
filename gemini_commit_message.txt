fix: Resolve 404 on /designs page on GitHub Pages

Moves the design listing page from `designs.markdown` to `designs/index.markdown`.

This makes the URL structure explicit and resolves an issue where the page was not being found on the live GitHub Pages site, despite working correctly in the local development environment.
