feat: Add designs collection and Docker-based local environment

Adds a new 'designs' collection to the Jekyll site to store design
documents separately from blog posts.

To enable local development without a system Ruby installation, this
commit introduces a Docker-based environment using a Dockerfile and
docker-compose.yml.

Key changes:
- Added a 'designs' collection in _config.yml.
- Created a page to list all design documents.
- Added an example design doc and a doc detailing the new Docker setup.
- Added 'webrick' to the Gemfile to ensure compatibility with Ruby 3+.
- Configured layouts to ensure consistent theme styling on design pages.
- Added .dockerignore to optimize the Docker build.
