docs: Add design for auto-syncing external documents

Creates a new design document that details the architecture and
implementation for automatically syncing files from external repositories
into the Jekyll site using a cross-repository GitHub Action.

The document also includes a section on alternative solutions that were
considered and rejected, such as using Git Submodules or a scheduled
job.

Gemini commit: use prettier to format it, then yes
